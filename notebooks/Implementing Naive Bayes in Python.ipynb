    "There are two major improvements we can make to our Naive Bayes classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Smoothing\n",
    "2. Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Glance up to how we estimate $P(x_f = v_f \\mid y = c)$. Unfortunately it will be very common to have counts of zero in the numerator. If we get a zero, the probability for the class will go to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\prod_{f=0}^{M-1} P(x_f = v_f \\mid y = c) =  P(x_0 = v_0 \\mid y = c) * \\dots * 0 * \\dots* P(x_{M-1} = v_{M-1} \\mid y = c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y=c) \\prod_{f=0}^{M-1} P(x_f = v_f \\mid y = c) =  0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y = c \\mid \\mathbf{x} = [v_0, \\dots, v_{M-1}]) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is undesirable, since it makes the model inflexible - unable to cope with configurations of values and classes unseen in the training data, without zeroing out.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fix for this is additive smoothing. We modify our estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_f = v_f \\mid y = c) \\approx \\frac{count(X[:,f] == v_f {\\&} \\mathbf{y} == c) + \\alpha}{count(\\mathbf{y} == c) + \\alpha n_f} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n_f$ is an estimate of the possible values that feature $f$ can take:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n_f = unique(X[:, f])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha$ is a smoothing parameter, usually $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$. We can search for a value of $\\alpha$ that results in good model performance, e.g. using cross validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can motivate this smoothing by looking at the case where the counts are zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_f = v_f \\mid y = c) \\approx \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha n_f} = \\frac{1}{n_f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The counts are zero, therefore our training data doesn't contain any examples of this particular class-value combination. Without smoothing, our estimate of $P(x_f = v_f \\mid y = c)$ would be 0. But now that we have smoothing, our estimate is that all possible values of $x_f$ are equally likely, given class $c$. This is a fair assumption to make if we don't have much data, and it stops the probability from going to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the counts are non-zero, $\\alpha$ blends together the probability derived from the emperical data (i.e. the counts), and the probability based on assuming all values are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also smooth our estimate of the class prior probability $p(y=c)$. However, because we estimated $C \\approx unique(\\mathbf{y}) $, we are guaranteed to not have values of 0 for any class prior. Therefore we will leave out the smoothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "We have improved our implementation by including smoothing, but currently we are still multiplying together potentially very small values; which is not great with floating point numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the class, $c$, that maximises $P(y = c \\mid \\mathbf{x} = [v_0, \\dots, v_{M-1}])$ also maximises $\\log{P(y = c \\mid \\mathbf{x} = [v_0, \\dots, v_{M-1}])}$. So we can switch to using log probabilities, and get the same answer. In log space multiplication becomes addition, and the numbers become more reasonably sized.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log{P(y = c \\mid \\mathbf{x} = [v_0, \\dots, v_{M-1}])} \\propto \\log{P(y=c)} +  \\sum_{f=0}^{M-1} \\log{P(x_f = v_f \\mid y = c)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_c \\log{P(y = c \\mid \\mathbf{x} = [v_0, \\dots, v_{M-1}])}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_c \\left[ \\log{P(y=c)} +  \\sum_{f=0}^{M-1} \\log{P(x_f = v_f \\mid y = c)} \\right]$$\n",
